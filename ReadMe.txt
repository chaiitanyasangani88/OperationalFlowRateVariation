# OperationalFlowCaseStudy
A detailed study about how the operational flow of a reservoir is effected by choke size, pipe size, well pressure solved using IPR and TPR equations
The project has has three studies: 
  1. Variation of operating flow rate with varying reservoir pressure for a given choke and pipe size.[Folder -> reservoir]
  2. Varition of operating flow rate with varying choke size and pipe size for a given pressure. [Folder -> choke]
  
The Inflow performance Relation (IPR) and Tubing Performance Relation (TPR) are solved to get the operational flowrate (Qsc) for a given set of reservoir pressure, choke and pipe sizes and depth. 

The compressibility factor is calculated by using Brill and Beggs's z-factor correlation.


The Pressure ranges, Temperature, Molecular weights and Zi can be updated to any sample and situation. Please make sure it is changed across all the files. 
Alternatively, one can be give them as input in all the functions.

Please go through the Presentation to get a better idea of the formulae used and procedure followed.
